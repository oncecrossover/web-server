<p><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snoop uses a variety of physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your information, based on the sensitivity of the information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Snoop or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices About Your Information</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may, of course, decline to submit information through the Service, in which case Snoop may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging into your account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Snoop does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 (or under the age of 14 for anyone living in Spain or South Korea) or knowingly allow such persons to register with the Service. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the relevant age without parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.</span></p>
