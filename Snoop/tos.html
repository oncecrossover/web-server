<ol>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each Transaction, Snoop will deposit into your Snoop account funds equal to ninety percent (90%) of the value of the credits that the Asker paid for the Transaction.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon making a withdraw request, Snoop will transfer to you (by debit account) all funds deposited into your Snoop account for Transactions. Snoop will have no other compensation obligations to you. You are solely responsible for any expenses you may incur with respect to Transactions.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may decide the amount of money an inquirer must pay for you to answer a question. </span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree to provide us with any tax reporting information we may reasonably require (e.g., submission of a Form 1099) before Snoop makes any payments to you.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Completion of Transactions.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You agree to (i) respond to each user&rsquo;s question within 48 hours of the posting of such request and (ii) use your best efforts to comply with any reasonable user requests for a Transaction that are consistent with the EULA.

If Snoop determines that the user&rsquo;s dispute of the Transaction is valid, Snoop will reimburse to the User the credits paid for the Transaction, and you will not be compensated for such Transaction. You agree that your only recourse if you disagree with Snoop&rsquo;s decision to reimburse a user and deny compensation to you is for you to terminate your relationship with Snoop.</span></p>
